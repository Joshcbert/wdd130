    <p>Hello All,</p>
    <p>
        I's Josh. I am currently a non degree seekig student working on growing my programing skills. I currenly work for a medical software company in Wisconsin. 
        As part of my job I have been working to improve our internal documentation that we keep internal wikis. As a result I have been wanting to learn html coding better and so here I am.
        Outside of want to learn html better I have also want to learn how to do carpentry. I think it would be super cool to be able to build furniture.
    </p>

        I have been married for 11 months now and love having my wife in my life! We met since we both moved to Wisconsin for work a few years ago. 
        We enjoy going going paddleboarding, camping and hiking in the summer. 
        In the winter we tend to play a lot of Catan, Cribbage and Wavelength (with friends).
        We want to learn how to ice skate better but last winter was too warm for the ponds and rinks to freeze. 
        If it doesn't get cold enough again this year I think Wisconsin will need a new reputation!
