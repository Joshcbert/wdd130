        Come to Madison Wisconsin! There are many fun things to do and places to see around town. Madison is the state capital and is built on an isthmus between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona. Only one other city is built on an isthmus (Seattle, WA). It has a diverse population with young professionals, government employees and students attending the University of Wisconsin Madison. Go Badgers! Enjoy fun for the whole family in a unique and beautiful city. The best part is you can get out of the city in less than 30 minutes and feel like you are out on the farm. The best of both worlds within minutes. Determine who has the best cheese curds between The Great Dane, The Old Fashioned or Dotty Dumpling's Dowry. Or go to Ian’s Pizza and try one of their crazy pizza flavors like mac and Cheese, baked penne or Drunken Ravioli.<br>
